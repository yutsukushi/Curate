## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
<p>Always getting the art questions wrong at pub quiz? Feeling uncultured when talking amongst your well-versed art posse? Are you just curious about modern art and don’t live near a museum? Or if you’re an artist, needing a source to collect all your contemporary inspirations? Well our app can help with that!</p>

## <a name="getting-started"></a> Getting started
<p>Our app lets you search and save some of your favorite art based on a search for an artist’s name. Users can create a user account and save them to their profile to access them later. Users can also delete them if they no longer want to keep them. Just create a profile to get started!</p>
